## What might the next iteration look like?

### Data model

- Store all changes, so that they can be un-done

### Frontend

- Svlelte / Sveltekit
- More consistent styling and unified styling approach
  - Tailwind vs CSS modules, maybe there's a place for both
  - More default styles for HTML elements? (Or less?)
  - Components vs. imported styles vs. custom tailwind classes
- List components - consider breaking them up, making consumer call `.map`
